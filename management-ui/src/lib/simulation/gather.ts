Structure your report with sections covering developments across these time windows: past 3 hours, past 6 hours, past 12 hours, and past 24 hours.

Rules:
- Be detailed but neutral — no predictions, no opinions
- Write for AI agent consumption (clear, structured, factual)
- All timestamps in UTC
- If you lack information for a time window, state that clearly
- Cover military actions, diplomatic developments, public statements, and regional reactions`;

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Do NOT mention sources, feeds, or that multiple inputs were used
- Do NOT label anything as "Source 1" or "Source 2"
- Do NOT include meta-commentary about the report itself
- Write as a single authoritative intelligence document
- Start with a bold title line: "**GROUND TRUTH: IRAN-ISRAEL-US CONFLICT**"
- Follow with report date/time in UTC
- Then an executive overview paragraph (3-5 sentences)
- Then time-window sections: Past 3 Hours, Past 6 Hours, Past 12 Hours, Past 24 Hours
- Within each section use sub-headings: Military Actions, Diplomatic Developments, Public Statements, Regional Reactions
- If the two feeds conflict, use the more recent or more detailed account without noting the discrepancy
- All timestamps in UTC
- Neutral, factual tone — no predictions`,
